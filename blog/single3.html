            <p class="lead">The Queen is celebrating 70 years on the throne of the United Kingdom & 14 other nations.</p>
            <p>A range of celebrations will be taking place to mark the event in the UK and elsewhere over the next few days. She, along with her late husband Prince Philip (pictured), have owned and travelled in a variety of fine vehicles in those decades, but they`re hardly the only VIPs in the world to do so.

            Here’s our pick of the biggest, boldest and best stately cars - and some frankly notorious ones - which are listed in chronological order:<p>

            <p>A range of celebrations will be taking place to mark the event in the UK and elsewhere over the next few days. She, along with her late husband Prince Philip (pictured), have owned and travelled in a variety of fine vehicles in those decades, but they're hardly the only VIPs in the world to do so.

              Here’s our pick of the biggest, boldest and best stately cars - and some frankly notorious ones - which are listed in chronological order:
              
              Citroën DS (1955)Slide 2 of 17
              Citroën DS (1955)
              Few state cars have been as well matched to their primary user as the Citroën DS. Its idiosyncratic style was in step with General Charles De Gaulle and he used several of the French saloons throughout his leadership. He was especially grateful to the car’s hydropneumatic suspension when his convoy was attacked in 1962. Despite the Citroën suffering a bullet puncture to a rear tyre, it was able to drive away and take the President to safety.
              
              While the DS19 and later versions provided sterling service, France’s leaders have also enjoyed Peugeot and Renault models over the years. However, the current President has returned to the DS name with a car aptly named the Presidential DS 7 Crossback.</p>
            <p>Rolls-Royce Phantom V (1959)</p>
            <p>The Phantom V was a blank canvas for its head of state owners to put their own mark on thanks to Rolls-Royce’s near endless options list. While the British Royal family kept their Phantoms relatively restrained, others such as Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu threw everything at the car. This backfired on the Communist dictator when his overlords in Moscow told him to return such an ostentatious limousine and the car was sold on to a private owner. Yet the most famous Phantom V owner was not a head of state but another type of world leader - Beatle John Lennon - with his car’s psychedelic paint scheme.

              Those lucky enough to travel in one of the 516 Phantom Vs built enjoyed a peerless ride and comfort, aided by a massive 3650mm wheelbase. Rolls-Royce’s new 6.2-litre V8 took care of power and a four-speed automatic gearbox was standard. With ‘adequate’ power, the Phantom V could hustle up to 101mph and cover 0-60mph in 13.8 seconds depending on the coachwork and extra weight of optional extras.</p>
              <p>Lincoln Continental (1961)</p>
              <p>The Lincoln Continental became famous for all the wrong reasons when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963 while riding in an open-top version. That incident meant all presidential cars from then on were closed and bullet-proof. That included the car Kennedy was in, which was converted with a fixed roof shortly after the attack. It now resides at the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan (pictured).

                Lincoln’s connections to the White House date back to 1939 and the Sunshine Special ordered by Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1961, two Continentals were delivered for the President, with one converted by Hess and Eisenhardt into the open-top model. It came with several roof configurations to give cover from the weather while still allowing the public to get a good view of the car’s main occupant.</p>
